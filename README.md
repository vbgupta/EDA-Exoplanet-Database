# EDA-Exoplanet-Database
# **About this Project**
As an Applied Data Science student focusing in Astronomy, the excitment of being able to combine the both fields to find Earth like planets (maybe the pontential for life) from data gather by telescopes is inspiring and motivating.

This is my attempt at analyzing this dataset.
